#  Contributing to Al·rishāʼ

Al·rishāʼ is a personal project, which is why it is being hosted on my personal GitHub and not in a separate Organization.
I am not personally interested in managing it as a large open‐source project and reserve the right to refuse contributions at any time, for any reason.
If I do not know you and you have not talked to me about contributing, chances of me rejecting your contribution are good.

But there is good news!!
Al·rishāʼ is public domain software, so you are free to fork it, modify your fork, or, indeed, even establish a whole Open Source Project around your fork to your heart’s content.

If you really like what I’ve done here and want to let me know (and perhaps collaborate), the best place to reach me is [on the fediverse](https://joinmastodon.org).
I currently reside at [@jellyfish_link@elekk.xyz](https://elekk.xyz/@jellyfish_link).
